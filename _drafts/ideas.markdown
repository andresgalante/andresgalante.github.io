## HTML/CSS is real in a way Photoshop will never be

Back in 2008 I had an eureka moment when I read [this article](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop#comments) from [Noise vs Signals blog](https://signalvnoise.com).

Jason Fried explains in 7 excellent reasons why they skip photoshop at 37signals, going directly from paper sketches to HTML/CSS.

This workflow made so much sense to me that I wanted to start right away and of course I couldn't. I was a freelancer and clients just love mockups.

During that time I was also starting with my own projects, and there I could do as I wished. 

But it wasn't until recently, working at Red Hat within an open source community that I saw how this workflow can improve the relationship between designers and developers and generate much better the result.


## Why bother

Jason goes over the [main reasons](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop#comments), but this is why I bother:

- Let's be honest: I am lazy. It takes lots of patience, effort and time to build an accurate photoshop image.
- Building UIs on Photoshop is a tedious painstaking work that never represent the end result, for example text in Photoshop is not the text on the web.

It's just a big waste of time. At the end of the day, implementation is done in HTML/CSS anyway. 

HTML/CSS is as much a drawing toll as photoshop, just better and real.

## Shows results intead of expectations

I am a designer and I work with developers. Developers have developer eyes, which are very different from designer eye. 

We designer are strange. We care about typography to the point that we get annoyed if the elevator numbers doesn't have the correct kerning. We generate pheromones when we see good alignment and spacing. We just care about things that not other human been does.

My boss once told me that it's if you handle an image to 10 different developers to implement you'll get 10 different results, and most likely none will be the one you envision. He is spot on.

When we handle a perfectly crafted UI image to a developer to implement, it's just silly to expect that he will care about the same things we do.

When I skip mockups and create HTML prototypes I am not only speaking the same language as the developers but also making sure things end up looking exactly how I intended.


## The paper to HTML workflow works

A few years ago I was in Beijing talking to one of the few Chinese persons I knew that spoke english. I asked why was it that almost none Chinese spoke english, and he told me that since there are almost 1.5B Chinese in the world, we should be the ones learning and Chinese and not the other way around.

And he was right.

On open source communities designers should adapt to the community workflow. Our deliverables must meet the team expectations and be inside comfort zone. We shouldn't expect to change a team mind to fit our ways.

This has work very well on the [Aerogear team](https://aerogear.org/community/). I've learn git to include my designs in the teams repo and I always do my best to help improve the UIs and UX without been dead weight on the team.

If I see that something a title is too big, I just make the change directly on the code, instead of drawing a mockup and try to convince some else of how important typography is.

I am sure I often fail, at the end of the day I am a designer. But I know that the team appreciates and support my effort and they help me in any way they can.


## I know I am biased

To me hifi mockups have always been a waste of time, but I may be biased too, because coding for me is much easier than using Photoshop for a web layout.

I work with extremely talented designer that don't code and are very successful are building UIs. I respect and admire them.

I hope my experience show a different path that has given me great satisfactions.
