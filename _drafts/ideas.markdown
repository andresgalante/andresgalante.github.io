If there is one thing I regret from my trip to QConRio is not having spent enough time talking with [Felippe Nardi](https://twitter.com/FelippeNardi). He has been developing on remote server for more than a year and he enter to the list of "Heroes". 

To be honest it's a quite large list that includes Michael J Fox for Back to the Future and Raphael turtle ninjas because he can kick ass.

That doesn't take away the fact that he has done something I always wanted to do and, ofcourse, always failed. I work on a very nice macbook pro (which I love) attached to a stupid and very bad samsung monitor that never gets colors right (which I hate). And although I like working on a mac, I don't want to be attached to it. If I travel, or if I want to work somewhere else I always need to take my large 15' computer. It's the only place where I have all my tools and envioments and files to work.

Felippe replaced his laptop for an ipad for a year and he proves that your development machine can be on the cloud, but what happen with designers. Can we replace my computer for a tablet or even a smart phone?

The answer is no completely.

What have I done?

I've look into a normal workweek and learn about my workflow. I've list the tools I use and cure to know which ones are really necessary.

My main concern is photoshop. Although I would prefer to work on Sketch, the team I work on uses photoshop and we share psd files. Even though a look a lot for it, I couldn't find a app replacement for desktop photoshop.

That been said there is no reason why I couldn't start coding on virtual machines. Well, actually there is, I don't know ssh or vin good enough.

And there are 2 solutions to that issue:

The first is to learn Vin, which is probably what I am going to do because I am big nerd and I am sure I'll brake things up in the process... and we all know there is no better way to learn something than to fix what we've broken. Plus I get to use the command line, and nothing feels better than successfully using the command line.

The second one is to use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). Which is awesome and easy to use, and although I should use it I won't... because well, I've just said it, I am a big nerd.

Practice makes the master. If I blog again about this in a few month then you'll know I succeed

This is a something I've always wanted to achieve: get rid of my computer. I've tried to do it with a smart phone

Three tips to build a design guide

Keep consistency

Create components and not webpages

Write good documentation. It would probably very very hard for a new person to do anything inseide the system, you have to teach them whever everything is. removes friction. improve comonnucation,s share knowlage and documented in a style guide.
Build the documentation within the product, use the style guide to build the tool.

dont buid one of. build a library of components.

well documented and arpochable.

reuse and refactor.

coding startdanrds. it should feel like ne person write it. Rules.

live examples, copy paste, no change anyone can screw things up.

dont write more css.

brake things into ocmponents and docs should rule everything. Docs driven development.


Make it easy to jump in and help each other. no matter what knowlage level



distributed teams work 

Patternfly is a Design systems.

everything that makes out your product open source framework

the aproach to open source treat it as open durce even though it isnt

cmponents and assets

What did we learn from patternfly HTML,CSS and JS components to build stuff on the web.

remove friction and help peoeple get things done.

we use our products to buils patternfly and we use patterfly to build our products




A few monthes ago I've got a Sam




If there is one thing I regret from my trip to QConRio is not having spent enough time talking with Felippe Nardi. He has been doing for a year something I always wanted to do.
 
Today, and after 8 month of waiting, I finally got an extra monitor.

I've been listening about Red hat Summit since I've started working at Red hat last November, and now is around the corner.

Apart from the PatternFly talk I am co presenting with Robb this Tuesday, and the Patternfly booth I'll be hosting during wendesday and thusrday, I've also been helping build the Red Hat Middleware Keynote.

It's been a long jurney from when we started till now and I have the pleasue to work with an amazing group of super talented people lead by Burr Sutter.  Today we had rehsresal and after seen the demo on a small screen both monthes, watching it in real life was a shock. The sheer size of the screens we are presenting it blew my mind.

you feel dirty. your kid will hug you and you have to wash first
if youwork at home you have a eew secnds to close the computer is not he will never want to be a designer


o desneho tem que estar envilvido em cada passo do desenvolvimento , design thinking

vou fazer o que os argentinos sabemos fazer de melhor

Ola, meu nome é Andrés Galante, eu sou Argentino, moro em Buenos Aires e trabalho na Red Hat.

Estou muito feliz de estar aqui, adoro o Rio, é sem duvida uma das cidades mais bonitas do mundo.

Perguntei para um amigo meu carioca se eu deveria dar esta palestra em ingles, e ele me falou que os Brasileiros valoram muito quando um estrangeiro tenta falar português, assim que pelos próximos 40 minutos é exatamente isso que vai acontecer: Eu vou tentar falar português.

Eu morei no Brasil durante um tempo e minha experiencia foi excelente, até achei legal aquelas coisas que ninguém gosta de falar, tipo o Programa do Ratinho o a Banda Calypso.

E é disso que vou falar: da Banda Calypso. 

Não, mentira, vou falar da experiencia dos usuarios e como na Red Hat construimos um framework para ter coherencia entre todos nosso produtos.



A great UI framework is the perfect intersection between aesthetic, behavior and implementation.
Patternfly make sure to look great, we user test every thing and have a beautiful implementation guid. We do the design so developers can focus on what they do best.




Só estou mostrando um mapa da Argentina porque da ultima vez que estive nos Estados Unidos, um colega meu achava que Buenos Aires fica na California.
