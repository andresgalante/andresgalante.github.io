If there is one thing I regret from my trip to QConRio is not having spent enough time talking with [Felippe Nardi](https://twitter.com/FelippeNardi). He has been developing on a remote server for more than a year and he has enter to my list of "Heroes". 

To be honest it's quite a large list that includes Michael J Fox for Back to the Future and Donatello Ninjas Turtle for kicking ass with a stick.

Felippe has done something I always wanted to do and, of course, I failed. 

I work on a very nice macbook pro (which I love) attached to a stupid and very bad samsung monitor that never gets colors right (which I hate). And although I like working on a mac, been restricted to it doesn't feel right. 

When I travel, or if I want to work somewhere else I always need to cary my large 15' computer. It's the only place where I have all my tools, environments and files.

Felippe proves that your development machine can be on the cloud by [replacing his laptop for an ipad for one year](https://medium.com/@felippenardi/start-coding-from-an-ipad-d942ebe44c63). 

But what happen with designers. Can I replace my computer for a tablet or even a smart phone? The answer is **not completely**.

## What have I done?

I've look into a normal workweek and learn about my workflow. I've listed the tools I use and filter them to know which ones are really necessary.

Then I look into online or ipad app replacements for them. And I found out that there is only one missing: Photoshop.

Although I would prefer to work on Sketch, the team I work on uses photoshop as a standard and we share psd files. I just couldn't find an app replacement for desktop photoshop.

That been said there is no reason why I can't start coding on virtual machines today. Well, actually there is, I don't know ssh or [vim](http://www.vim.org/) good enough, or how to set a VM.

I see 2 solutions:

The first one is to learn how to do it. Which is probably what I am going to do because I am big nerd. I am sure I'll brake things up in the process but we all know there is no better way to learn something than fixing what we've broken. Plus I get to use the command line, **nothing feels better than successfully use the command line**.

The second one is to use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). Which is awesome and easy to use, and although I should go for it I won't... because well, I've just said it, I am a big nerd.

## Practice makes the master

**The best way to do something is by just doing it**, that's why I will stop writing now.

Thanks Felippe, you are a hero.
