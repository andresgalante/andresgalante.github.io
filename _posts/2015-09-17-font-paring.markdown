Today [Bruno](https://twitter.com/abstractj) asked me about font pairing. He wanted to change [his blog](http://blog.abstractj.org/) styles and have a different typefaces for the titles and the text.

Here is what I have to say about font pairing: **Don't do it** unless you really know what you are doing.

Typography is really hard. Choose just one font family you and can't go wrong, even if that font family is [comic sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans).

Remember to pick a font family that has several styles. Then create contrast by changing the weight.

For example this blog uses [Titillium Web](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Titillium+Web) from [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). Titles are semi-bold and the body text is light.

## What if I want to it anyway?

Bruno asked. 

So, if you really want to get into font paring and you don't wan't study typography for years, copy from someone else.

Typekit has an excellent [gallery](https://typekit.com/gallery) to get "inspired".

If you want to go Google fonts way (and you should) check [Google type project](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/).

[Beautiful web type](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/) has some very nice examples on how to use font on the web.

For print samples check [Font you](http://ifontyou.com/) and [Fonts in use](http://fontsinuse.com/).

And always remember Picassos words:

>Good artist copy great artist steal

There you go Bruno, I've already told you all this a few minutes ago, now it's written.
