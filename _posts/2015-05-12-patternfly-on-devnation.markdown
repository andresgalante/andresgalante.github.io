![DevNation + PatternFly](/img/patternfly-devnation/devnation-patternfly.jpg)

If you follow this blog, the fact that I've been involved in the [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org) community for the past few months (and that it's an awesome project) shouldn't be new.

The big news is that the PatternFly team and I will be at [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit) and [DevNation](http://www.devnation.org) in Boston this year and you can meet us there.


## What is PatternFly

[PatternFly](patternfly.org) is a community project that promotes design commonality and improved user experience. Its offerings include visual and behavioral patterns based on research and UX best practices that solve common design problems. 

## What is DevNation

[DevNation](http://www.devnation.org) is an Open Source Conference by and for developers across the globe. It'll be held on June 21th to 25th, 2015 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, MA

## DevNation + PatternFly

Robb Hamilton and I are giving a PatternFly presentation to introduce the community, show what we are doing at Red Hat and how you can be part of this project.


This presentation will be on Tuesday, June 23th at 11:40AM in Room 202.

You can find us and other members of the PatternFly team in the PatternFly Booth located in the Red Hat Developer Community Central Room (Room 210) on Wednesday, June 24th and Thursday, June 25th.

We will be available to talk about UX, front-end development, design or answer any questions. Plus we'll be giving away super cool PatternFly t-shirts, stickers and if you star the PatternFly community on GitHub, you may win a Pebble Watch. Make sure to visit our booth for more details and to enter the drawing. 

For a closer encounter with the community, we will also be giving a demo at in the Community Central Room.
