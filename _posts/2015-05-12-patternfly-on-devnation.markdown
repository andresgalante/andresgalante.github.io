![DevNation + PatternFly](/img/patternfly-devnation/devnation-patternfly.jpg)


If you follow this blog, the fact that I've been involved in the [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org) community for the past few month (and that it's an awesome project) shouldn't be new. 

The big news is that the PatternFly team and myself will be at [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit) and [DevNation](http://www.devnation.org) in Boston in June and you can meet us there.

## What is PatternFly

[PatternFly](patternfly.org) is a community project that promotes design commonality and improved user experience. Its offerings include visual and behavioral patterns based on research and UX best practices that solve common design problems. 

## What is DevNation

[DevNation](http://www.devnation.org) is an Open Source Conference by and for developers across the globe. It'll be held on June 21th to 25th, 2015 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, MA

## DevNation + PatternFly

Robb Hamilton and I are giving a one hour talk to present PatternFly. We’ll introduce the community, show what we are doing at Red Hat and how you can be part of this project.

This presentation will be on Tuesday, June 23th at 11:40AM on Room 202.

You'll also find us and others from the PatternFly team at the PatternFly Booth at the Red Hat Developer Community Central, Room 210 during Wednesday 24th and Thursday 25th.

We will be available to talk about UX, front-end, design or answer any question. Plus we'll be giving away super cool PatternFly t-shirts, stickers and there’ll be a draw for a [Pebble Watch](https://getpebble.com) for the ones that visit our Booth and star the [PatternFly community on GitHub](https://github.com/patternfly).

For a closer encounter with the community, we will be giving a demo at the Community Central.

Come visit us at DevNation in June. Register with code **RHSRAF** for 10% off at [devnation.org](http://www.devnation.org).
