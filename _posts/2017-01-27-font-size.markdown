![Font size pixels to rems](/img/font-size/font-size.jpg)

Beginnings are never easy and setting good foundations for a project is key to avoid
headaches down the road.

That’s why the CSS Army decided to use relative units to measure typography (and
everything else except from borders) to develop the CSS of the latest version of
PatternFly.

## Rems

We measure fonts-sizes in rems.

For example if the root html is set to `20px`, then `1rem = 20 px`.

The trick is to avoid hard coding a font-size for the html element. That way
1rem will be equal to the font size base of the browser. In most cases it’s
`16px`, but users can set it larger or smaller, or browsers can have a larger or
smaller root font size according to its environment.

By using rems the typography hierarchy changes proportionally following the
browser's setting.

It sounds awesome, right? Well... there is one challenge.

Photoshop can’t do font-sizes in rems. And when the visual designers delivers a
mock up with a font-size in `px` we need to find a way to express it in `rems`.

## Math and Sass to the rescue

With a little bit of math, the translation from px to rem is easy. First we
create a variable to set a value for the root. We don’t apply this value to any
element, it works just as a reference point.

Since most browsers font size base is `16px`, then the font-size-root variable is
`16`:


{% highlight css %}
$pf-font-size-root = 16;
{% endhighlight %}

Let’s say the `h1` is defined to `24px` on photoshop. So `24` divided by the root font
size, in this case `16`, is `1.5`. Therefore `24px = 1.5rem`. Then we
multiply it by `1rem` to add the unit.

The sass formula end up been:

{% highlight css %}
(24 / $pf-font-size-root) * 1rem
{% endhighlight %}


Putting it all together it looks like this:


{% highlight css %}
$font-size-root: 16;
$h1-font-size: (24 / $font-size-root) * 1rem;

h1 { font-size: $h1-font-size }
{% endhighlight %}


## It’s like cheating

We are using this technique to set font-sizes, margins and paddings and it has
yield excellent results.

It’s not like cheating, it is cheating. It is also the best way to reproduce
Photoshop image in code maintaining the benefits of relative units.
