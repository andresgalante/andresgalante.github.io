Data visualizations are fascinating. When well executed, they are an amazing medium to visually represent massive volumes of dynamic information.

But of course that's not easy.  From a simple pie chart to a [complex infographic](https://www.pinterest.com/jeeda85/dashboards-uiux-and-chart/), they each offer complicated design challenges.

As part of the effort to promote common dashboards, the [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/) team will cut a release this week that includes PatternFly styles for C3js charts, and [Aerogear Unified Push Server](https://aerogear.org/) UI will probably be the first to implement them.

>If a picture’s worth a thousand words, what’s the value of an image representing a terabyte of data?

Hunter Whitney asked in this excellent [article](http://uxmag.com/articles/beyond-the-pie-chart).

##PatternFly charts

For this first release, patternfly charts will include:

- Line Chart
- Sparkline
- Spline Chart
- Area Chart
- Stacked Area Chart
- Bar Chart
- Stacked Bar Chart
- Donut Chart

But there are plans to expand this list with heat maps and other charts soon.

## C3js + PatternFly styles

They are based on the robust and tested [C3.js](http://c3js.org), which is a [D3-based](http://d3js.org) reusable chart library.

Patternfly charts are superbly designed to **keep consistency with the rest of the library styles**. They are optimised for good readability, their colors are color-blind tested and they show animations which supports the interactions and hierarchies.

##PatternFly at DevNation

I'll be in PatternFly booth at [DevNation](http://www.devnation.org). If you happen to be around, **let's geek out about charts!**
