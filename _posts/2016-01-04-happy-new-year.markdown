![Bye bye 2015, welcome 2016](/img/new-year/new-year.jpg)

2015 has been a superb year. Looking back, I can't believe how much has happened.

It was my first year at Red Hat, which allowed me to work alongside and learn from a bunch of talented people that made me grown a lot as a person. And I couldn't be happier that I can count some of them as my friends by now.

I felt in love with open source and had the chance to participate in fun projects. 

I also spoke for the first time in english at DevNation in Boston and in portuguese at Qcon Rio, which opened the doors for my next presentations in english and portuguese at DevNexus and QConSP.

But thats not all, I started running, started writing this blog, continued working on my personal projects and watched my baby grow into a little boy.

There is no doubt that I end this year as a better designer. What waits for me in 2016? I don’t know but I can’t wait for it.

This is a short post and I just wanted to write it to wish all the readers of this blog (yes, both of you) a happy new year!
