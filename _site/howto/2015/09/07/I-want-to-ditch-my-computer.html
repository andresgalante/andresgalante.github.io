<p>If there is one thing I regret from my trip to QConRio is not having spent enough time talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/FelippeNardi">Felippe Nardi</a>. He has been developing on a remote server for more than a year and he has enter to my list of “Heroes”.</p>

<p>To be honest it’s quite a large list that includes Michael J Fox for Back to the Future and Donatello Ninjas Turtle for kicking ass with a stick.</p>

<p>Felippe has done something I always wanted to do and, of course, I failed.</p>

<p>I work on a very nice macbook pro (which I love) attached to a stupid and very bad samsung monitor that never gets colors right (which I hate). And although I like working on a mac, been restricted to it doesn’t feel right.</p>

<p>When I travel, or if I want to work somewhere else I always need to cary my large 15’ computer. It’s the only place where I have all my tools, environments and files.</p>

<p>Felippe proves that your development machine can be on the cloud by <a href="https://medium.com/@felippenardi/start-coding-from-an-ipad-d942ebe44c63">replacing his laptop for an ipad for one year</a>.</p>

<p>But what happen with designers. Can I replace my computer for a tablet or even a smart phone? The answer is <strong>not completely</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-i-done">What have I done?</h2>

<p>I’ve look into a normal workweek and learn about my workflow. I’ve listed the tools I use and filter them to know which ones are really necessary.</p>

<p>Then I look into online or ipad app replacements for them. And I found out that there is only one missing: Photoshop.</p>

<p>Although I would prefer to work on Sketch, the team I work on uses photoshop as a standard and we share psd files. I just couldn’t find an app replacement for desktop photoshop.</p>

<p>That been said there is no reason why I can’t start coding on virtual machines today. Well, actually there is, I don’t know ssh or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> good enough, or how to set a VM.</p>

<p>I see 2 solutions:</p>

<p>The first one is to learn how to do it. Which is probably what I am going to do because I am big nerd. I am sure I’ll brake things up in the process but we all know there is no better way to learn something than fixing what we’ve broken. Plus I get to use the command line, <strong>nothing feels better than successfully use the command line</strong>.</p>

<p>The second one is to use <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>. Which is awesome and easy to use, and although I should go for it I won’t… because well, I’ve just said it, I am a big nerd.</p>

<h2 id="practice-makes-the-master">Practice makes the master</h2>

<p><strong>The best way to do something is by just doing it</strong>, that’s why I will stop writing now.</p>

<p>Thanks Felippe, you are a hero.</p>
